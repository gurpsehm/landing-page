# landing-page
Landing page project for The Odin Project

Creating a landing page to demonstrate my skills with using the CSS Flexbox Layout and HTML

# What I Learned

* How to search for and troubleshoot problems I had with manipulating the Flexbox.

* Learning when and how to nest Flexboxes to lay out divs the way I want them to look on the page.

* When to look back and reference old lessons and material when facing similar problems I did during the lesson activities.

* Understanding that it's okay to redo parts of sections later on if I come up with a better idea later on for the webpage or if something I tried earlier ends up breaking other sections or looking odd later on.

* Taking breaks really helps when you're stuck and coming back with a fresh mind can help make a very difficult problem much easier or digestible.
